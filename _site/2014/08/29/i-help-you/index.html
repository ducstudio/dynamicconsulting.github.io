<h2 class="title"><a href="http://localhost:4000/2014/08/29/i-help-you/">I help you</a></h2>
<p class="post-date"></p>

<div class="entrybody">

<p>I help you...
        your organization, your department, your non-profit, your business
        you as an executive director, a manager, a co-worker, a leader
        you as a spouse, a parent, a citizen, a partner in life
                                ...reach your full potential.</p>

<p>I coach you in a process towards an end result and you guide the way.  Sometimes it is all about the starting point, sometimes it is all about the end point and sometimes it is all about the journey.  Most often it is about the weaving of all three together.
I grew up on a dairy farm in southwestern Pennsylvania.  I find myself sharing this fact more and more the further away I get from my childhood years.  This fact is one component of my life that I can be pretty certain will show up in conversation in the initial stages of a relationship.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for me to ask others to share some of the moments and components of their life that have most shaped who they are today.  I was recently pondering what the process would look like and what it might reveal if I asked people to narrow that list down to the most influential moment.  As I pondered what that might look and feel like, I started to think more deeply about the main components of my life that most often show up in conversation...</p>

<p>I grew up on a dairy farm.
    I am the youngest of three girls.
        My first overseas experience was at 17 when I spent one month in Russia.
            My graduating high school class was 99% white.</p>

<p>I initially chose Hamilton College because I was attracted to the brochure they sent.
    I completed a Religious Studies major - Russian Studies minor - pre Med emphasis.
        I was on the college rowing team for one year.
            Photography is one of my favorite hobbies.</p>

<p>I spent six years living and working in South Africa.
    I left my career and entered graduate school after almost losing my life in Afghanistan.
        I have spent time in 11 countries and have studied 4 languages.
            I was given a sheep that was slaughtered in my honor.</p>

<p>Marriage to my husband took me to Juneau, Alaska where I currently live.
    I am a certified Zumba instructor.
        I have a 13-year old step daughter.
            My faith is a key component of my life.</p>

<p>The impact of these key components are varied but they each reveal a different piece of who I am today and how I have been influenced on my journey.  I challenged myself to think about the key component that has been the most influential in my life and in who I am today.  </p>

<p>I grew up on a dairy farm.  </p>

<p>A bit shocking to me that this statement is what I have settled upon as the most influential piece of who I am today.  I can remember a time when I was not overly proud of the fact that I grew up on a dairy farm, a time when I felt like it hindered who I was or made my childhood less than what others experienced.  </p>

<p>As I have taken steps further and further away from my childhood I can look back and see the threads that started in that place - some of my passions got rooted on the farm, some needs that I have for feeling connected to life have surfaced as needs because I am not on the farm, experiences that I often strive to recreate for others got shaped by the freedom and space that I feel while on the farm, and analogies and metaphors for how I understand life contain pieces and characteristics of life on the farm.  </p>

<p>Life is a journey.  There is a starting point, there are ending points, and there are middle grounds.  There are threads that run throughout.  There are pieces of our journey that can feel less than desirable and yet in some way they remain a piece of who we are.  There a pieces that we can chose to eliminate in the journey ahead and there are pieces that we can chose to add into the journey.  </p>

<p>I am a partner for you on that journey - no matter where you come from and no matter where you are going, I am a thought partner for you on the journey.  You determine where you are going.  I help you get from where you are to where you want to be.  </p>

<p>Creating pathways,
    finding space,
        acknowledging cycles,
            discovering connection
                experiencing growth,
                        witnessing change</p>

<p>We journey together to reach your full potential.</p>
